Keep in mind database credentials need to be inputted manually by the user.
We used Vaadin Flow to build our user interface using all the built-in components to create a seamless, visually appealing and responsive user interface. 

Special libraries/frameworks we used are the following: 
Binders to provide validation control for form/dialogue fields 
Spring boot was another which we used to query data from the database 
Finally, Vaadin flow provided us with an easy-to-use way to create a fully responsive and visually appealing view.
